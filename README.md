# PD2_StoryLineWiper
Clears the story line in the Career section of PAYDAY 2 so you can replay it from the beginning and track your progress.

_Inspired by [fragtrane's](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods) [Replayable Story Line](https://modworkshop.net/mod/25510) mod._

Adds a settings menu in the Mod Options, as well as a dialog button inside the Career view:
